In today's project we will understand the Single Linked List in C programming by solving a number of predifined tasks.
There is a lot of general and detailled resources about linked lists.

Our porject includes 5 mandatory tasks and 2 advanced tasks (optional).

Mandatory tasks:
Task 0:
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf
